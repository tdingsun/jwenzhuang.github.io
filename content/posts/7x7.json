But, as if preprogrammed, she bombs the conversation into the dark, abysmal land of confronting one’s demons: therapy, mental asylums, ugly truths (or convincing lies). In fact, the night had already teetered off balance early on, when I ordered fries and she ordered tea, and then I ordered tea and she ordered meatballs. There we were: eating fries, slicing up meatballs, rinsing oil with tea, wondering about life and what happens if we don’t live it. One large, overly seasoned mess.\n\n“I went to visit her a week after the incident,”\n\n“I had to push through two heavy doors, then round a sharp corner to finally arrive at this big, empty room.”\n\n“All the patients wore large blue shirts and thick yellow socks, like ducklings.”\n\n“Oh, and before all that I had to sign my name, my reason for visiting, my relationship to the patient, all of that onto this piece of paper. Boyfriends, brothers, mothers, mothers, mothers, friends—the papers of signatories were thick.”\n\n“I wanted to be better than all of them though, so I wrote in best friend.”\n"
