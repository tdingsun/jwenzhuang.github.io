This makes it easier for researchers and outside visitors to look through the collections at HFA. Additionally, I overview and edit monthly program calendars.\n\n[Here is an example](https://harvardfilmarchive.org/collections/arturo-ripstein-papers) of a summary I wrote for their personal collection on the Arturo Ripstein Papers.\n\n![alt text](assets/hfa_3.jpg)\n"
