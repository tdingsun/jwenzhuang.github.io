I'm a freelance writer, editor, and book worker. I work within the fields of critical pedagogy studies, aesthetics, and radical publishing. My research is particularly interested in how labor and autonomy, how play and restraint, are individually and simultaneously enacted and denied within certain systems and structures. I organize with workers and students around [debt](https://debtcollective.org/).   

For fun, I try and collect things on my [are.na](https://www.are.na/wen-z). And watch movies that I write about on my blog, [code unknown](https://code-unknown.com/). There's also the newsletter I run, [a&nbsp;fountain](https://afountain.substack.com/).
