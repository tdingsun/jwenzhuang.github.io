# *Horror Vacui*: The Poetics of Afrofuturism and the Missing Cosmos of the American Cinemascape

> What are the conditions under which the meanings attached to the idea of "going up" might become confused with those attached to the process of "going down"? How do notions of upward mobility become associated with physical orientations to the sky, to the stars, to the reaches of outer space? What might it mean to find oneself at the bottom - economically, socially, physically - just at the moment one appears to be traveling up, up, and away? Does it involve the process of crashing down from on high, or might highness itself be a “bottomless pit”?

## Introduction

In Martine Syms’ 2013 “The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto,” she lists 14 promises that the collection of “Mundane Afrofuturist literature” will follow.2 All 14 begin in the space of negation, with many refusing fundamental elements of what we’ve come to consider as Afrofuturism: no alternative universes, no magic or supernatural elements, no interstellar travel. We quickly recognize Syms’ rules are in response to a separate model of Afrofuturism, one that has seen a renaissance in recent years with films like Black Panther, the literature of Sheree Renée Thomas, Janelle Monae’s third studio album Dirty Computer. The rules of the manifesto is a refusal not of the this renaissance but of the acceptance of Afrofuturism—a "genre-forming” effect of the white, Hollywood, dominant gaze that solidifies what Afrofuturism was, is, should be. Syms is attempting to reclaim and interiority for the movement. Number 2 reads: “No inexplicable end to racism—dismantling white supremacy would be complex, violent, and have global impact.” Number 3 reads: “No aliens unless the connection is distant, difficult, tenuous, and expensive—and they have no interstellar travel either.” The only rule that does not begin in repudiation is number 14: “To burn this manifesto as soon as it gets boring.” With the last rule, Syms wrests a level of power and authority away from the dominant gaze, the white man’s hand and racism’s lens—who can do this burning? She asks, as she anticipates who might take on the mantle. Afrofuturism’s resurgence is not all flawed. It has created chasms in otherwise impenetrable paradigms: Janelle Monae’s third studio album Beyond, Black Panther’s position in the Marvel Universe. This resurgence, however productive, has major shortcomings that are due for a reconsideration. As part of the 2020-21 Research Fellowship at the Harvard Film Archive, I’ve selected a list of films, media, and texts— both original and referenced—that attempt to re-expand the method and philosophy of Afrofuturism as an approach in and of itself, not just as a strain of Science Fiction. The difficulty in defining Afrofuturism begins in the impossibility of attributing it to a label— movement, method, approach, genre all feel lacking. For the purpose of my program, I will refer to Afrofuturism as a distinct kind of poetry. I focus on three aspects of our the contemporary considerations of Afrofuturism that feel particularly lacking: the question of gaze, the problem of the fantastic (read: nonexistent, superior) in relation to the other and forms of acceptance, and the issue of timeline and the inaccurate tracing of the relevance of this poetic.
